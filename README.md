# utils
This repo is a collection of utilities commonly needed by Information Technology organizations in support of the services they provide (in a standardized way).

There are different ways that [utils] - this repo, could have been structured, but it was decided to order things by area/language/platform (e.g. C#, HTML, Oracle, SQL Server, etc).

For additional details, contact Vern Huber or the ITS Application Development and DB Support (ADDS || UISappDeveDL@uis.edu ) team.

Files in [utils ] are shared externally to the University â€“ careful.

Consider providing an additional README file in a functional subfolder to provide even more details (e.g. [README_utils_xxx] where 'xxx' is 'oracle').

This repository was started Sept. 2017 with UIS' local GIT repository and ported to GitHub later (Ja. 2019).
