************UISSQLEmail DLL Documentation************

Importing and Using the DLL file

To start off, download the DLL file and save it some where on your hard drive.  Then in your "Solution Explorer"
in your project right-click on "Refernces" and select "Add Reference".  In the window the comes up select the "Browse" tab.
Now browse to the DLL file and select and hit OK.  You should now have the DLL in the your "References" list.

To use the DLL you simply need to have the correct using statement.  Then you can use the class that is provided.
Here is a bare bones to get started:

using UISSQLEmail;

namespace DllEmailTest
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            SQLEmail email = new SQLEmail();
        }
    }
}

Note:  The namespace is UISSQLEmail and the class name is SQLEmail.

************Using the SQLEmail Class************
The SQL email class is easy to use.  The only necessary parts required are the To and From addresses and a call to the 
send email method.  A skeleton program looks like this:

using UISSQLEmail;

namespace DllEmailTest
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            SQLEmail email = new SQLEmail();
			
			email.ToEmailAddress = "test@test.com";
			email.FromEmailAddress = "recipient@test.com";
			
			email.sendEmail(); //Passes variables to procedure uis_sendmail
        }
    }
}

If you want to send an email with a body and subject you simply call their respective accessors.

using UISSQLEmail;

namespace DllEmailTest
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            SQLEmail email = new SQLEmail();
			
			email.ToEmailAddress = "test@test.com";
			email.FromEmailAddress = "recipient@test.com";
			email.Subject = "Test";
			email.Body = "This is a test";
			email.sendEmail(); //Passes variables to procedure uis_sendmail and executes.
        }
    }
}

If you want to CC or BCC multiple people you pass in a string of emails separated by a semicolon.

using UISSQLEmail;

namespace DllEmailTest
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            SQLEmail email = new SQLEmail();
			
			email.ToEmailAddress = "test@test.com";
			email.FromEmailAddress = "recipient@test.com";
			email.Subject = "Test";
			email.Body = "This is a test";
			email.CC = "cc1@test.com;cc2@test.com";
			email.BCC = "bcc1@test.com;bcc2@test.com";
			email.sendEmail(); //Passes variables to procedure uis_sendmail and executes.
        }
    }
}


************Setting Variables************
There are several variables that you can get and set by calling its accessors.  In the "Using the SQLEmail Class" the
ToEmailAddress and FromEmailAddress are both accessors that allow you to get and set the toEmailAddress and fromEmailAddress variables
in the UISSQLEmail class.  This is the only way to access the variables.  Below is a list of all the variable names, their types, and
their defaults.

        string profileName = "uisappdev";
        string executeQueryDB = "";
        Decimal groupID = 10;
        string bodyFormat = "html";
        string importance = "NORMAL";
        string sensitivity = "NORMAL";
        bool attachQueryResultAsFile = false;
        bool queryResultHeader = true;
        Int32 queryResultWidth = 256;
        string queryResultSeparator = " ";
        bool excludeQueryOutput = false;
        bool appendQueryError = false;
        bool queryNoTruncate = false;
        bool queryResultNoPadding = false;
        bool applicationError = false;
        bool sendAutonomously = false;
        string runType = "HELP";

        string fileAttachment = ""; - Has been tested but failed.  Tries to pull file off the server machine and not the local machine that's running the DLL
        string toEmailAddress = "";
        string fromEmailAddress = "";
        string subject = "";
        string body = "";
        string replyTo = "";
        string cc = "";
        string bcc = "";
        string query = "";
        string queryAttachmentFilename = "";

        mailItemID has not been created because you can't set an int variable to null.
