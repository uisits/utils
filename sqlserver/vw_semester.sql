/*
File:	utils/sqlserver/vw_semester.sql

Desc:	Single record view for providing access to common semester/term codes.

Note:	Some re-working may need to occur depending on when a term is no longer
		considered current.
		
See:	[ CDM/all/all_semesters.sql ] - Oracle counterpart view object and supporting objects.
		...formerly at [utils/oracle/vw_semester.sql ];

		[ utils/sqlserver/vw_sem_alternate.sql ] - different semester window defition;
		
Enhancements:
		* Convert this to call against the Oracle view (so logic is in one place).
				
Usage:	select current_term from uis_utils.vw_semester

Schema:	current_term	: Current term ID, e.g. 420151
		previous_term	: Previous term relative to the current term
		next_term		: Next term relative " "
		next_fall_term	: Next Fall term " ", if current_term is Fall, it is a year ahead;
		cur_term_name	: Readable name of the current term, e.g. "Spring 2015", for term = 420151;
		prev_term_name	: " " previous term relative to the current term
		next_term_name	: " " next term " "
		
		academic_year	: Academic year, e.g. 1415

Author: Vern Huber
		2/19/2020 : Issue arose Summer '19 - and forwards but not with Spr'18, where [academic_yr_cd]
		was ok using [openquery] directly, but not via a view.  Solution was to enclose fields in the
		Oracle select in double quotes.

Issue with accessing in large joined db object operations - you might see:

   Msg 7346, Level 16, State 2, Line 1
   Cannot get the data of the row from the OLE DB provider "OraOLEDB.Oracle" for linked server "oraprod".
